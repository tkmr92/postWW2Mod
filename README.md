# Post World War 2
A mod for Hearts of Iron IV that begins immediately following WW2.

This mod will be very event focused, and will allow the player to steer the cold war in a direction they should choose.

Will the world remain in a quasi-stable high-tension peace period, or will the two emerging superpowers of the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics reduce Europe into yet another World War?

The Mod will be broken up in to five phases: 
1: Korean Phase (1945-1955)
2: Post-Korea (1955-1962)
3: Vietnam Phase (1962-1979)
4: Afghanistan (1979-1989)
5: The Rise of Extremism (1989-2000)

We will focus on releasing and polishing phase 1 before expanding and polishing phases 2 and 3. We plan on representing not only the interesting choices presented in playing a new class of nation "Superpower", but also the decline of the colonial powers as French, Dutch, and British colonies begin to vie for their independance. This will allow not only an eventful and interactive experience in Europe, but also an ever-changing landscape of rising and falling powers throughought Africa and Asia.
